# 🔮 PredictMarket — Polygon Prediction Markets Program Application

## Project: PredictMarket — Binary Prediction Markets Protocol

### Overview
PredictMarket is an on-chain binary prediction market protocol enabling anyone to create, participate in, and resolve YES/NO markets on any topic. Built with proportional payouts, oracle resolution, and invalid market refund protection.

### Features
1. **Market Creation** — anyone can create YES/NO markets with resolution time
2. **Proportional Payouts** — winners share the entire pool proportionally
3. **Real-Time Odds** — live calculation based on pool ratios
4. **Oracle Resolution** — designated oracle resolves markets (YES/NO/INVALID)
5. **Invalid Market Refunds** — full refund protection if market is deemed invalid
6. **Protocol Fee** — configurable 2% fee for sustainability
