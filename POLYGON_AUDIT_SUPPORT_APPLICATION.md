# 🔮 PredictMarket — Polygon Audit Support Program Application

## Project: PredictMarket — Binary Prediction Markets on Polygon

### Overview
PredictMarket is a fully-tested, deployed binary prediction market protocol seeking audit reimbursement to deploy safely on Polygon mainnet. The protocol enables permissionless creation, participation, and resolution of YES/NO prediction markets with proportional payouts and oracle resolution.

### Audit Readiness
- **Contract:** `PredictMarket.sol` — 1 contract, ~300 lines
- **Tests:** 31/31 passing
- **Coverage:** 98% lines, 100% functions
- **Static Analysis:** Slither clean — no critical/high findings
- **Deployed (testnet):** `0x9Aa87Cff875c671af7EDE5d750d0Ea747ABC23F0` (Celo Sepolia)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/bigguybobby/polygon-predict (public, MIT license)

### Estimated Audit Cost
- Scope: ~300 LoC, 1 contract
- Estimated: $5,000 - $15,000 depending on auditor
- Requesting: partial or full reimbursement

### Why Polygon
- Polymarket ecosystem — largest prediction market is on Polygon
- Low gas enables many small bets
- Growing prediction market user base

### Post-Audit Plan
1. Deploy to Polygon mainnet
2. Integrate with Polymarket data feeds
3. Add multi-oracle support (Chainlink, UMA)
4. Launch liquidity incentive program
